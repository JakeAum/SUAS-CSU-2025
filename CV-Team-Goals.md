We earn Points based on the quality of our map.

```text
A sliding score of 0 to 100 points will be given based on the submitted map's quality.  Maps will be evaluated for coverage, projection accuracy, stitching, and other quality signals. A high quality map will be indiscernible from a professional-quality map seen on services like Google Maps. A medium quality map will have noticeable defects like minor stitch errors, varying exposures, minor missing coverage, and other minor issues, but wonâ€™t detract from use as a map. A map of insufficient quality will receive no points for the mapping task.
